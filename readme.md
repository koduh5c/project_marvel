# HOW TO USE

- CHARACTER SEARCH BAR - **press ENTER to get suggestions based on current input.** Will already cache the characters searched for suggestions so searching those characters will ask to hit the cache. If an exact character name is directly entered, it will request info straight from API as it won't have cached anything.

- SEARCH BUTTON -  **Click this button to search for information on the entered character.** It will ask to hit cache if it already exists, otherwise it will search the API.

- COLLECTION LIST - **DOUBLE CLICK** to go browse that collection.

- BREAD CRUMB BAR - **Click the relevant bread crumbs to explore recent history**. The bar can be scrolled left and right using the mouse once filled up.

- SEND REPORT BUTTON - **Click this to open up a form to send an email of the currently viewed information in a rearranged format.** All fields must be filled before clicking submit. There will be a feedback before closing on whether the report was successfully or not.
